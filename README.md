# Big picture

this started as a project to generate my yearly financial report using haskell
and has evolved a bit to be a [simple webapp](https://myfinancereport.com/).
I actually rewrote it in react + fastapi, so that is currently what you see on the site.

# Features

- parse PDF bank statements and credit card statements
- categorize expenses
- generate reports
  - per month drill down
  - summary -> per transaction drill down
  - configurable sankey and column diagrams
- allow for manually update transactions from a ui

# Tech

- haskell for backend and webserver
- html for report
- postgres to persist data
- LLM for PDF parsing (using structured outputs)
- LLM for categorization (using structured outputs)

# Disclaimer

this is mainly a project through which I will learn more about haskell, but I expect the code to be bad.

# User feedback

- manually add transactions
- admin page doesnt work
- demo account
- edit transactions
- show stats
- toasts are broken
- sort is broken for dates
- privacy policy
