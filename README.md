# Big picture

make my yearly financial report using haskell

# Features

-> parse bank statements and credit card statements
-> categorize expenses 
-> generate "report"
-> (potentially) try to serve the resulting report with haskell 
-> (potentially) allow for an interactive interface 
-> (potentially) allow uploading documents to generate "live" reports

# Tech

-> haskell for "backend" 
-> html for report
-> sqlite to persist data
-> LLM for PDF parsing  (using structured outputs)
-> LLM for categorization (using structured outputs)

# Disclaimer 

this is mainly a project through which I will learn more about haskell, but I expect the code to be bad.
